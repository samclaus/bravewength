Coup is a popular card game for 2-8 players which revolves around bluffing and deception. It was designed in 2012 by Rikki Tahta.

## What this module contains

This module is a [Go (or Golang)](https://go.dev/) library which implements a [WebSocket-based](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) server for the game.

This repository does **not** include any UI (user interface) code, and it probably never will. I wanted to open-source the server/backend code so people can learn how they might implement a (relatively simple) real-time online game, but I feel the actual UI is more a matter of personal expression and I don't want people to easily copy my website's look-and-feel. This repository implements a pretty performant game server so that you can focus on the UI/client side of things (talking to the server, pretty buttons and animations, etc.) if you wish to learn web programming.

You can play the finished game on my website: <https://samcla.us/projects/coup>.
